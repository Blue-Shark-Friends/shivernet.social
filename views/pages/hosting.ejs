    </h3>
    <p>
      You can render your Shiver Dock personal site as static pages that can be hosted anywhere that offers hosting for static sites (e.g. GitHub Pages or Neocities). Personal sites generated by Shiver Dock currently contain no dynamic elements, but in the future dynamic elements may be offered. Blue Shark Friends cannot offer these future upgrades to you if you choose to host it this way. We can offer guidance for hosting it this way if you would like assistance.

    <h3>
      - <a id="dynamic">Self-Funded Dynamic Hosting</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can pay for your own hosting and serve the Shiver Dock personal site pages dynamically. This is the recommended route for those who can afford their own hosting as any future upgrades that we make available should be compatible. If you go this route, you will need to make sure your host supports running Node.js apps. There are many hosts that offer this service (e.g. Heroku) but not all do, so please check first. We cannot offer free consulting, but we are happy to provide technical consulting for a fee. We will include instructions for running the Node app in the package.

    <p>
      You can host your Shiver Dock personal site on <a href="https://shivernet.social">shivernet.social</a>, a service provided by Blue Shark Friends. Shiver Dock Kickstarter backers who pledge at any website reward tier receive a free year of hosting, but future years will require an annual subscription.
